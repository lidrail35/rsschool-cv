## About me
I'm 45 years old. Currently I am working at the Belarusian Railways as a team leader. I have 24 people under my direct supervision. We are engaged in the maintenance and operation of telephone and telegraph equipment. I understand that my profession is losing its relevance, and I want to change my occupation to a more promising one: to become a front-end developer.
